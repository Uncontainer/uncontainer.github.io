category: Building a financial lending platform on Docker 
description: We built a platform for an innovative lending platform based on Docker which abstracted out redis, elasticsearch, postgresql, ruby on rails and celery. <br/> This platform was migrated from Rackspace -> AWS within a few hours as a consequence of containerization.

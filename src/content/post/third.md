Docker and Kubernetes are compatible with various cloud providers - including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.... as well as bare metal, plain servers like Rackspace and Softlayer 

Our containers are also compatible with any programming language - whether PHP, Java, Ruby, Python... or some of the more esoteric R and fortran.

You can even run your production environment on your laptop!
